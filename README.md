### Linear Search

- **Description**: A simple search algorithm that checks every element in the list until the desired element is found.
- **Time Complexity**: O(n)
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
- **Code**: [LinearSearch.java](src/com/algorithms/search/LinearSearch.java)

### Binary Search

- **Description**: An efficient search algorithm that works on sorted arrays by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.
- **Time Complexity**: O(log n)
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
- **Code**: [BinarySearch.java](src/com/algorithms/search/BinarySearch.java)

### Jump Search

- **Description**: A search algorithm for sorted arrays that works by jumping ahead by fixed steps and then performing a linear search within the block.
- **Time Complexity**: O(âˆšn)
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
- **Code**: [JumpSearch.java](src/com/algorithms/search/JumpSearch.java)

### Interpolation Search

- **Description**: An improved variant of binary search for uniformly distributed data, estimating the position of the target value.
- **Time Complexity**: O(log log n) in the best case
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
- **Code**: [InterpolationSearch.java](src/com/algorithms/search/InterpolationSearch.java)

### Exponential Search

- **Description**: An algorithm that first finds the range where the element is present and then performs binary search within that range.
- **Time Complexity**: O(log n)
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
- **Code**: [ExponentialSearch.java](src/com/algorithms/search/ExponentialSearch.java)

### Fibonacci Search

- **Description**: A search algorithm based on dividing the array in a way similar to Fibonacci series.
- **Time Complexity**: O(log n)
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
- **Code**: [FibonacciSearch.java](src/com/algorithms/search/FibonacciSearch.java)

### Ternary Search

- **Description**: Similar to binary search, but divides the array into three parts instead of two.
- **Time Complexity**: O(log3 n)
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
- **Code**: [TernarySearch.java](src/com/algorithms/search/TernarySearch.java)

### Getting Started

To get started, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aishwarya-wagh/Searching_Algorithms.git
cd Searching_Algorithms
```

### Usage

Each algorithm is implemented in its respective Java file under the src/com/algorithms/search directory. To use an algorithm, you can directly import the class into your project.
